# Privacy Policy

The services provided by MishaTun are intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for those who choose to use our Service.

By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The personal information that we collect is used solely for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise defined here. The Terms and Conditions are available within the individual apps.

## VPN Data

We DO NOT collect or store any VPN data.  
We DO NOT modify the contents of your VPN data.  
We DO NOT share any sensitive or user-specific data with third parties.  

MishaTun is a non-centralized VPN app. Users connect to their own custom-configured servers, and the app does not provide any centrally controlled servers. This means that, as a user, you have full control and responsibility for your VPN data. The app itself does not in any way modify VPN data as it leaves your device and is sent to your configured VPN server.

## Data Collection

MishaTun only collects and shares crash logs and diagnostic information.  
Crash log data may include, for example, the number of times the app has crashed, stack traces, or other technical information directly related to a crash.  

Analytics data may include information such as how long a user spent on a certain screen in the app. This information is collected and processed by Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics. It is used solely to improve app quality by ensuring that crashes and bugs are identified and fixed. No personally identifiable information is collected or shared.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

MishaTun does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone, including children. As a result, no personally identifiable information is collected from children under the age of 13.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to third-party websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Please note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of those websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are therefore advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any updates by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after being posted.
